**Tinkercad Arduino Bomb Defusal Game (C++)** <br /><br />
I made this project because I thought making a game would be the most interesting choice while using the arduino. When I first started to plan out what I was going to do, I decided that using 2 arduinos would give me the result I was looking for. Some challenges I had were to get information sending between the two seperate arduinos but once that was working the game started to come together. If I was to recreate this game I would like to fully implement a hard mode that includes 2 more buttons with 2 more lights to add an extra level of difficulty with the timer remaining the same as the medium difficulty. I would also like to come back to this project at some point and fix some of the code because now when looking back the way I did it does not make much sense and I should be able to improve upon the game. <br /><br />

**Style Stage CSS Final Project** <br /><br />

I made this project for my final in advanced CSS. Our teacher wanted us to make our own variation of the stylestage.dev webpage. I decided that I wanted to go with something easy to read with full size scaling for different devices.

**Python Final Excel Sheet Searcher** <br /><br />

I made this Python project for my old job, it was made to speed up the process of searching through an excel sheet that stores names of people who have or have not read the policies and procedures for Pinecrest Nursing Home. It simply asks for at least 1 name and then it checks the sheet to see if there is a match if there is it grabs all of the information for that chosen person. Then it checks to see if the person has or has not read the policies and procedures if the have it will not create a word document but if they have not read any of them it will create a word document directed to the person which lets them know that they have 1 week from when the document was made to read and sign the policies and procedures. <br /><br />

**HTML/CSS Final Project** <br /><br />

I made this project with a few people in my first semester class of HTML/CSS. It is a basic webpage designed to show of Motorola DynaTAC 8000x. It could have been better but I think for a first project in HTML/CSS it has a solid base to work off. <br /><br />

**Rock Paper Scissors C#**<br /><br />
This was my final project for Programming fundamentals in C#. This was a cool project which allowed me to work with C# to create a classic game that everyone knows. There are a few issues with the code itself. One of these issues would be that the input handing could only catch 1 missinput before it will crash the application. With what I know now I will be redoing this project and correcting some of the errors that I had with it.<br /><br />
